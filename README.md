# Bubble-Game
In this game, HTML, JavaScript DOM Manipulation, and CSS are used.

When the player clicks on the bubble corresponding to the current Hit number, the player's score increases by 10, and then a new Hit number is displayed, with the timer counting down from 20 to 0.

When the timer reaches 0, the game ends, and the player's score is shown. Players can choose to play again by clicking on the "Play again" text.

If the player clicks on the wrong bubble that does not match the Hit number, the game will also end and display the player's current score. They can still play again by clicking on the "Play again" text.
